     * Short introduction into bitwise ops:
     * & = bitwise AND, it returns the bits that are turned on in both parts
     *     0x0001 & 0x0101 = 0x0001
     * | = bitwise (inclusive) OR, similar to AND
     *     0x0100 | 0x0010 (int = 4 | 2) = 0x0110 (or 6)
     *
     * ^ = bitwise (exclusive) XOR, think of it as "this or that, but not both!"
     *     (decimal)    (binary)
     *          5     =  101
     *          6     =  110
     *      ------------------ xor
     *          3     =  011
     *
     * ~ = unary bitwise complement, switches the state of the bits
     *     ~0x0011 becomes 0x1100
